THE TOKYO MANJI GANG'S MANIFESTO

The **Tokyo Manji Gang** *(東京卍會, Tōkyō Manji-Kai?)*, often abbreviated as **Toman** *(東卍, Tōman?)*, is a biker gang based in Shibuya, Tokyo. It was known for its honorable ideals and beliefs that contributed to its goal of establishing a new golden era for delinquents in the Kanto region. However, this image crumbled as its ranks were continually corrupted and transformed into a criminal organization that took the lives of innocent civilians in the present day.

Throughout its reign, Toman took on several gangs and declared victory against them, causing it to rapidly grow its numbers until its disbandment. Two years later, Toman is rebuilt by Takemichi Hanagaki under the Second Generation denomination as an effort to take down the Kanto Manji Gang and retrieve Manjiro Sano.
